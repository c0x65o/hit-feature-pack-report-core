    # - none: deny all access for this verb/entity (hide pages + block APIs)
    # - all: ignore scope (read everything, respecting visibility and shares via dashboard storage)
    # - own: only owned reports (report.owner_user_id === current user id, via dashboard storage)
    # - ldd: same as own (reports don't have LDD fields, so can't check LDD)
    #
    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
